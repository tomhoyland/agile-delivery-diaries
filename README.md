# The Agile Delivery Diaries
Maybe this is a book, maybe it's a cookbook for the agile delivery community? In the fullness of time, we'll see.
## Who is it for?
- Anyone interested in building a product, service or delivery team
- Anyone wanting to improve their agile delivery practices
- Anyone who wants a good yarn on what went well, what didn't and the lessons learned
- People with job titles like; Agile Coach, Scrum Master, Delivery Lead or Manager, Squad Lead, Release Train Engineer (if you’re into all that SAFe stuff), Head of Delivery etc. 
—- If you’re a Project Manager (in the classical sense) then stop reading, this is not for you. Go read your Prince2 manual instead and create a Gantt chart. 
## How is it structured?
### A Recipe 
- Essentially it’s an ordered list of tasks and things to do. Think of it as a recipe. The sequence begins from the position of a new Agile Coach/Scrum Master/Delivery Lead joining a team and sets out useful things to do to help understand, support and nurture a them on their journey. The content is based on my personal experiences of working with a variety of teams in a range of settings. 
- You may notice that tasks are written in a direct, matter of fact way. They’re meant to be as I don’t have all the time in the world, but in most cases each task does have an explanation and rationale. 
- You may also find that some tasks ask you to do things like collect data, engage with stakeholders or ‘just do stuff’ without little explanation as to why. Don’t worry, it’s written that way and if you follow the steps you’ll find that all those things you collected at the start will end up being useful along your journey. Just like Lord of the Rings, except not set in New Zealand. 
### Candid Advice
- It’s a very personal Q&A with the author. It includes some of the bizarre scenarios he’s found himself in, how he reacted to them at the time and in hindsight whether this was the right thing to do. 
- The primary goal of this section is to provide an outlet for reflection and therapy for the author. A secondary goal is to provide readers with a bit of comedy and maybe learnings. 
## What happens if I follow the tasks and perform the rituals?
- *You will create the best team on Earth.* No, you won’t, but you will help your team to grow and develop, tackle common challenges facing newly formed or existing agile teams and work out what’s right for you. 
- *You will have a recipe for cloning teams and creating an armada of identical agile teams to take over the world.* No, you won’t. If you follow the tasks outlined you won’t create identical teams. Teams are made up of different people with different hopes, dreams, backgrounds, neurodiversities. If you follow the steps outlined you will build and nurture very different teams that should be optimised for their context and each other. 
- *You will learn more about what it takes to build a high performing team.* Yes, kinda. No recipe guarantees success, but this is a good starting template. It’s served the author well in the past and helped him repeatedly form new teams, navigate challenging situations and reach what is considered to be a high level of performance, or a be in a position where other teams exclaim “hey, I want some of that!”.
- *You will learn more about yourself.* This approach isn’t for everyone. The steps it outlines and the positions it takes might make some readers recoil. It doesn’t always follow the accepted doctrine on building teams and products, but that’s part of the fun of trying new things. If anything, by reading and following these steps you’ll learn a lot more about yourself, what works for you and what you’re comfortable with. I won’t charge for that that therapy, consider it a freebie.
